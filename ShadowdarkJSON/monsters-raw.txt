and a diamond-hard, spiked carapace. It towers overhead like a 
mountain, able to swallow entire villages in one gulp. The tarrasque 
hibernates deep in the earth or at the bottom of the sea for 
centuries, only awakening long enough to fill its vast belly in an 
indiscriminate rampage of terror and destruction. There is only one 
tarrasque, and it is the most dreaded creature to walk the earth.

THE WANDERING MERCHANT
A cheerful merchant who appears to be a hale, middle-aged 
human man with a handlebar mustache. He wears a white shirt, 
breeches, and leather apron, and he hauls a towering backpack 
bursting at the seams. Few know the merchant's true nature and 
origins, though some theorize he is an immortal being or a god 
(they are not entirely incorrect). The Wandering Merchant always 
has something useful, far-flung, or incredible to sell at a reasonable 
price, and there's no telling when or where he'll show up next... 
"Fancy meeting you here, at the bottom of a pit trap! 
I just so happen to have this lovely rope for sale..."
